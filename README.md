# AWS EKS Cluster creation

There are multiple ways in which an *EKS cluster* can be created
each has its own merits and drawbacks.

This repo created to maintain different EKS provisioning methods and sample applications
Started with the least efforts one by using **eksctl + aws alb ingress controllers ** 

Later would be extended to AWS CDK, Terraform.
